# MRT
## What is this?
MRT, or My Rate Tables, is a dynamic web application demo built in the ASP.NET MVC 5 framework using a code-first approach. I put it together in order to continue practicing with - and demonstrate my level of skill at - building solutions in ASP.NET MVC.

## What can be done with it?
A user can create an account for use in accessing the site's sub-sections in order to read, create, or modify records concerning made-up insurance carriers, the policies that cover them, the codes that identify specific types of jobs in certain states, and the worker's compensation rates corresponding to combinations of all of these different variables. This behavior mimics some of the functionality of the project after which it's modeled.
